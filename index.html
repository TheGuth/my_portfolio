      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Prior to web development, I use to teach Social Studies in my home town of Peru, Indiana.
        As an Educator, Coach, and colleague I always have had a passion for technology and chose to use it to enhance the learning process both in and out of the classroom.
        Even as I began my journey of learning to code,  I still want to keep my past experiences as an educator in mind as i continue
        to develop applications and make them accessible. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <!-- Mom is math teacher, aka puzzles and problem solving -->
        <!-- Gorwing up in a household where my mom was a math teacher, you could say that problem solving was hamhered into my brain. Solving puzzles was a daily routine, and was a fun one at that.
          I Remember having to do a scavenger hung solving both linquistic and algebraic problems to help me study for finals when I was in jr. High.
        -->
        <p>I have always loved a good challenge, and being able to go
        from identifying the big picture problem, to going down into the
        fine details of a program to fix a bug, I can't get enough. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>One of the most important skills as a web developer is the ability to communicate clearly. I have worked on multiple team projects
        and have found this to be the most important aspect. My past experience as an educator has been very helpful in
        creating clear goals and rules for past projects in how work was assigned and when goals were met.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I love board games, video games, and generally just hanging out with friends. However if you
        think you can beat me in some good ole Nitendo 64 games like smash, or mario cart we will need to talk. Other than that
        I'm a pretty chill guy who loves playing fetch with my German Shepard and going on walks with my wife.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Whether it is helping someone realize their dream, or working on an exciting side project, I will always
        be excited and push to do my best. I think that helping someone bring an idea to conceptualization is an amazing thing, and
        I am always looking for ways to help people realize their dreams.</p>
